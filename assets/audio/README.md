# Audio Files

Place your audio files in this directory with the following names:

## Background Music
- `bgm.mp3` - Background music that loops during gameplay

## Sound Effects
- `shoot.mp3` - Sound when player throws/shoots a rock
- `hit.mp3` - Sound when a bullet hits a ball/bubble
- `player-hit.mp3` - Sound when player gets hit by a ball
- `powerup.mp3` - Sound when player collects a power-up
- `enemy-hit.mp3` - Sound when bullet hits an enemy (jet/tank)
- `enemy-destroyed.mp3` - Sound when an enemy is destroyed

## Audio Format Recommendations
- **Format**: MP3 (most compatible)
- **Bitrate**: 128-192 kbps for music, 64-128 kbps for sound effects
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Background Music**: Should loop seamlessly (consider using a looped audio file or ensure the beginning and end blend well)

## Volume Control
The game respects the volume settings in the settings menu:
- "Intifada" = Full volume
- "Silent" = No sound

Background music plays at 50% volume relative to sound effects to maintain a good balance.
